We found two ports open in the previous task. RDP won't be of much use to us without credentials (or at least a hash, although Pass-the-Hash attacks are often restricted through RDP anyway); however, the webserver is worth looking into. Wreath told us that he worked on his website using a local environment on his own PC, so this bleeding-edge version may contain some vulnerabilities that we could use to exploit the target. Before we can do that, however, we must figure out how to access the development webserver on Wreath's PC from our attacking machine.

We have two immediate options for this: *Chisel*, and *Plink*.
