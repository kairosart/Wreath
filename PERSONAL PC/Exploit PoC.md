Ok, so we know what is likely to happen when we access this page:

- It will probably ask us for creds
- We'll be able to upload image files
- There are two filters in play to stop us from uploading other kinds of files
- Both of these filters can be bypassed

Perfect -- let's access the page!

Let's head to the `/resources` directory.

As expected, we are met with a request for authentication:

![[Exploit PoC-20250128210433691.webp]]

We can assume that the username here is _probably_ either `Thomas` or `twreath` -- both of which we have already seen. We also already have one of Thomas' passwords, stolen from the Git Server using Mimikatz ([[Stabilisation & Post Exploitation]]).

See if you can login using these usernames with that password!

How cute -- a page to allow Thomas to upload pictures of his beloved cat, Ruby.

Try uploading a legitimate image -- see if you can access it!
