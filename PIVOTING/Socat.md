Socat is not just great for fully stable Linux shells[[1]](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoshells), it's also superb for port forwarding. The one big disadvantage of socat (aside from the frequent problems people have learning the syntax), is that it is very rarely installed by default on a target. That said, static binaries are easy to find for both [Linux](https://github.com/andrew-d/static-binaries/raw/master/binaries/linux/x86_64/socat) and [Windows](https://sourceforge.net/projects/unix-utils/files/socat/1.7.3.2/socat-1.7.3.2-1-x86_64.zip/download). Bear in mind that the Windows version is unlikely to bypass Antivirus software by default, so custom compilation may be required. Before we begin, it's worth noting: if you have completed the [What the Shell?](https://tryhackme.com/room/introtoshells) room, you will know that socat can be used to create encrypted connections. The techniques shown here could be combined with the encryption options detailed in the shells room to create encrypted port forwards and relays. To avoid overly complicating this section, this technique will not be taught here; however, it's well worth experimenting with this in your own time.  

Whilst the following techniques could not be used to set up a full proxy into a target network, it is quite possible to use them to successfully forward ports from both Linux and Windows compromised targets. In particular, socat makes a very good relay: for example, if you are attempting to get a shell on a target that does not have a direct connection back to your attacking computer, you could use socat to set up a relay on the currently compromised machine. This listens for the reverse shell from the target and then forwards it immediately back to the attacking box:

It's best to think of socat as a way to join two things together -- kind of like the Portal Gun in the Portal games, it creates a link between two different locations. This could be two ports on the same machine, it could be to create a relay between two different machines, it could be to create a connection between a port and a file on the listening machine, or many other similar things. It is an extremely powerful tool, which is well worth looking into in your own time.

Generally speaking, however, hackers tend to use it to either create reverse/bind shells, or, as in the example above, create a port forward. Specifically, in the above example we're creating a port forward _from_ a port on the compromised server _to_ a listening port on our own box. We could do this the other way though, by either forwarding a connection from the attacking machine to a target inside the network, or creating a direct link between a listening port on the _attacking machine_ with the service on the internal server. **This latter application is especially useful as it does not require opening a port on the compromised server.**
