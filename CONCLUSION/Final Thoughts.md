Thus we reach the conclusion of the Wreath network.

We covered a wide range of topics in this room -- combined there was a lot of information to absorb, so kudos for getting here! Hopefully you've learnt some new tricks along the way, no matter your prior experience (or at the very least been able to apply known concepts to a new situation).

This room was designed to be an introduction to the topics covered -- now that you've completed Wreath you should be able to confidentally tackle some of the other networks on the site, if you haven't already.

A huge shoutout to all of the amazing testers of the Wreath Network!
