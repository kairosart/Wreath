In the last task we got remote command execution running with the highest permissions possible on a local Windows machine, which means that we do not need to escalate privileges on this target.

In the upcoming tasks we will be looking at the second teaching point of this network -- the command and control framework: Empire. Before we do that though, let's consolidate our position a little.

From the enumeration we did on this target we know that ports 3389 and 5985 are open. This means that (using an account with the correct privileges) we should be able to obtain either a GUI through RDP (port 3389) or a stable CLI shell using WinRM (port 5985).

Specifically, we need a user account (as opposed to the service account which we're currently using), with the "Remote Desktop Users" group for RDP, or the "Remote Management Users" group for WinRM. A user in the "Administrators" group trumps the RDP group, and the original Administrator account can access either at will.  

We already have the ultimate access, so let's create such an account! Choose a unique username here (your TryHackMe username would do), and obviously pick a password which you don't use _anywhere_ else.
