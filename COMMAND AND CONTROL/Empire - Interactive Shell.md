The interactive shell was a new feature in Empire 4.0. It effectively allows you to access a traditional pseudo-command shell from within Starkiller or the Empire CLI Client. This can be used to execute PowerShell commands, as you would in a Powershell reverse shell.

## Empire CLI

To access the interactive shell in the Empire CLI Client, we can use the `shell` command from within the context of an agent:

![[Empire - Interactive Shell-20250123205005577.webp]]

## Starkiller

In Starkiller this is even easier as the shell can be found directly in the Agent interaction interface:

![[Empire - Interactive Shell-20250123205124652.webp]]

Whilst not quite as "familiar" as the command line shell, this gives us the exact same access.
