We have now covered the fundamentals of working with a command and control framework. Empire is significantly more extensive than the basics we have looked at in the time and space available here, so it's well worth doing some more research on it in your own time!

The overarching take-aways from this section are:  

- C2 Frameworks are used to consolidate access to a compromised machine, as well as streamline post-exploitation attempts
- There are many C2 Frameworks available, so look into which ones work best for your use case
- Empire is a good choice as a relatively well-rounded, open source C2 framework
- Empire is still in active development, with upgrades and new features being released frequently
- Starkiller is a GUI front-end for Empire which makes collaboration using the framework very easy

This has very much been a whistle-stop tour of both the Empire framework and the topic in general, but hopefully it has been useful nonetheless.

**[Bonus Exercise]** Try working through this section again, using a different C2 Framework of your choice. You can use the C2 matrix to help with this.
